# Hello World  
  I am a full stack bloackchain developer from the united states. I mainly work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Solidity and React Framework, as well as work in WordPress.
  
  I am an entry-level developer who is looking for an entry level position. My education has came from CodeCademy and projects from FreeCodeCamp. An entry level blockchain developer would be my ideal position, although, I am open to taking a job developing with JavaScript or React framework. I have a hard work ethic and a willingness and passion to start a career as a developer.
